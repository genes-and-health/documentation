2. If you do not have this already, download just

MacOS
```bash
brew install just
```

3. From your terminal, go to this repo (now locally on your computer) and make a new branch. Git has some excellent instructions on git branching. For reference, do:

```
git checkout -b "name_of_new_branch"
```

4. Make a virtual environment, with the command:
```
just virtualenv
```

If you want to do this manually, you can make a virtualenv through the normal methods - `python -m virtualenv .venv`. 

5. Activate this virtual environment and install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt file. There is a shortcut for the installation step using `just`. 

```
just devenv
```

```
just serve
```

7. Make any changes you want in a text editor (recommend VS code)
8. Add and commit any changes in files and then push back to Github. Make a pull request. A member of the admin team will review the changes and approve or comment on them. 

> Note that when you make a pull request, a live version of your changes will be created by Cloudflare which we are using for hosting. The cloudflare bot will comment on your pull request with the URL for this.

Genes and Health uses a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) to provide access to its data. This is a secure platform that allows researchers to analyse the data without the need to download it.  Genetic and health record data (curated and raw) are regularly updated and maintained in the TRE. 

## Why a Trusted Research Environment (TRE)?
The TRE model is increasingly being used for large-scale health data studies because of the benefits of security, ease of dataset maintenance, and the ability to bring users to the data rather than sending data to users. Data security is the number 1 priority for Genes & Health, and the TRE model allows us to ensure that the data is secure and up-to-date. 

We are not the only study using a TRE. There are many large genetics and health data studies such as Finngen, UK Biobank, Genomics England, NIHGRI that are using the Trusted Research Environment model. Health Data Research UK is strongly supporting this model. For more information about TREs, see [our explainer](/explainers/tre). 

## Volunteers’ data security
Volunteers have trusted us with their genetic and health data. The health data in particular is extremely sensitive, even when key personally identifying information (e.g. full dates of birth, names, postcodes) have been removed. 

The Genes & Health Study Protocol states “NHS patient identifiable data will be stored in an ISO27001 and NHS Information Governance toolkit data safe haven (with controlled export) in the UK”

## Ease of dataset maintenance
The ‘bring users to the data’ model (rather than the traditional ‘send users the data’) allows much easier maintenance and updates. Because the multiple, linked, datasets are only in 1 place, we can be sure that everyone has access to all the latest datasets and are not using outdated versions. Some of the genetic datasets are also very large (~Tb) and sending these out as regular updates to multiple users is difficult.

The Genes & Health team is based at Queen Mary University of London. There are a number of teams within the project: 

- **Research Team**: responsible for the design and conduct of the study, including data collection, analysis, and publication of results.
- **Data Team**: responsible for the management and curation of the data, including data linkage, quality control, and data access.
- **Stage 1 Team**: responsible for the recruitment and consent of participants.
- **Stage 2 Team**: responsible for the follow-up of participants, including inviting participants for further research studies and carrying out these studies.
- **Lab Team**: responsible for the processing and analysis of DNA samples.

Our Trusted Research Environment (TRE) is administered by the Sanger Institute (using Google Cloud Platform), and the data team works closely with them to provide curated data and useful tools. 

In addition to these teams, there is an Executive Committee that oversees the project and provides strategic direction. They are supported by a number of advisory groups, including a Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group.

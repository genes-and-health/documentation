Genes & Health is a long term genomic medicine longitudinal population study of British Bangladeshi and British Pakistani adult (age 16+) volunteers. This involves volunteers providing a saliva DNA sample,  consent to data linkage to multi-source NHS electronic health records and consent to be invited for further research (with further ethics/consent step).

Participants who have consented to be contacted for further research may be contacted by the Genes & Health team for further research studies. These studies will have their own ethics and consent processes, and may involve further data collection (e.g. blood samples, questionnaires, interviews, etc).

## Cohort Profile

The Genes & Health cohort profile was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology in 2020. The full text is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyz174). This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the cohort, including the study design, recruitment, data collection, and baseline characteristics of the participants, and we recommend reading it before using the data. At the time of publication, the cohort consisted of 38,000 participants. Since then, recruitment has continued, and the cohort now includes over 55,000 participants (updated in April 2024). 

In addition to East London, the study has expanded to Bradford and Manchester.

There are a number of features and milestones that we would like to implement in the future. These are listed below:

- Better billing controls, capping spend on WDL pipelines, for example
- Allow users to put their own data in. Some sort of 1-way rysnc to a google bucket? Will need to be sandbox specific
- Put raw health data in once ISO27001 compliance achieved

Only admins can install new software. As there is no internet access, this also includes CRAN, github, PyPI etc. To get a new software installed, please raise a helpdesk request. This is done by emailing [hgi@sanger.ac.uk](mailto:hgi@sanger.ac.uk) to generate a ticket. This will take a few days to
a week to complete. 

!!! warning
    Please note that if you wish to use a package that relies on an 
    external service, such as a database or reference data, you will need make sure that this data is also available on the TRE. This
    is because the TRE does not have internet access and cannot connect to external services.
    
## Developer requests    
If you are a developer and want to install custom software for example, a python package that you have written, you can request this to be installed by the Sanger Institute. It will be available to all users. This may require some additional information to be provided to the Sanger Institute particularly around security and data protection.

Apologies this is tricky! Either copy paste it in using the Clipboard, or from an existing document/script already in the TRE.

Or if you must you can type as follows:

Press Ctrl+Shift+u (it has to be Ctrl, not Command)

You should see a "u" appear, underlined, at your cursor

Type "23", then press Enter

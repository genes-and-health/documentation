Users and Administators can get help in a number of ways:

1. Genes & Health Industry Consortium users - use the Microsoft Teams chat

2. Genes & Health Internal users - use the Slack chat

3. Software issues - raise a ticket by emailing [hgi@sanger.ac.uk](mailto:hgi@sanger.ac.uk) with your request, rather than using Slack/Teams - this ensures the request is properly logged and can be tracked.

4. Documentation - if you have a question about the documentation, or would like to suggest an improvement, please raise an issue on the [documentation GitHub repository](https://github.com/genes-and-health/documentation/issues).

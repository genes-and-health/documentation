When first set up, users will get an email from Google (to their normal email address). This will have a [_username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk_](mailto:username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk) username. You need to Add this as a Profile in Google Chrome. Don't try and use any other browser than Google Chrome! 

!!! warning

    This username is not an email address and we won't send email to it. It cannot receive email. It is just a username for the TRE.

Once you have done this, go to Manage Your Account / Security and turn 2 Step Verification on. You'll need to enter a phone number and get a code by SMS/text message. You can't get into the TRE without this on.

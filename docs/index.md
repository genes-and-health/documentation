This is the documentation site for the Genes and Health project.

The Genes and Health project is a huge long-term study of 100,000 people of Bangladeshi and Pakistani heritage in the UK. We investigate genetic factors that influence health and disease in these population. To do this, we link genes with health records to study disease and treatments. 

This site is intended to provide information and guidance for researchers using Genes and Health. If you are a member of the public who wants to learn more about the project, please visit our main website at [www.genesandhealth.org](https://www.genesandhealth.org).
